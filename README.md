# Dynamic-Authorisation-Matrix
I am creating a application which will (hopefully) replace the old school charts or excel files for authorisation matrices.

**Version 2.0:**

- Added the option to switch functions indexes.
- Added the option to move functions.
- Slight performance optimization.

**Version 1.1:**

- Added suggestions when typing function names.
- Changed JSON format.

**Version 1.0:**

- Created the display of authorisation matrix.
- Made the display scrollable.
- Added the option to switch between light and dark mode.
- Added the option to add a function.
- Added the option to remove a function.
